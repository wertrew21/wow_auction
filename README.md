This python modules get API data from WoW auction data from Game data API.
In addition it carries out data pre-process (such as removing abnormal values)
and turn the original data from API into organised csv format.
It's going to make table and plot graph with csv files.

[PLAN1] I'm making a webserver to show table and graph when you request it.
[PLAN2] When enough number of API data is stored, I wanna apply regression model on the data to show expected values to come.
